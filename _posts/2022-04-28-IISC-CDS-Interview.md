## CDS Interview Experience
22nd April 2022

>First students were shortlisted on basis of there gate score after that there were two rounds. In first round there were 5 mcq questions on probability, matrix and graphs. Further there were 2 coding questions. Sample paper are available in IISC website and most of the questions will be of simmilar format.

>Next all students were called for an offline interview round. They will ask you questions and you have to explain your answers on the board. They asked me few questions on matrix and coding. The questions I remember are as follows:-
>
>1. Write a code to find 2nd max number in an array. Tell its time complexity.
>2. How to find null space in a matrix?
>3. Null space when rank = n and why?
>4. A=UU' say one eigen value of A. U' represents transpose of U.

## Electronics System Interview
24th April 2022

>First Students were shortlisted on basis of gate score and then there were two rounds(written and interview). In written there were 20 questions on variety of topics. There were 2-3 questions on mosfets, one question on electrolysis(12th chemistry),few questions on Opamps etc.
> Next there was interview round, most of the questions were from my final year project, How we did it, its effect and use and problems faced. Besides this they asked questions on Buck converter, draw its circuit diagram and derive the result. Supply a switch by using arduino only as a controlled switch.
