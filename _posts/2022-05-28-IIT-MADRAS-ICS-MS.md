In IIT madras EE6 department has 3 divisions for doing MS. They are analog, digital and TI sponsored MS. Each division will have a different selection criteria. In beginning they will ask which all domain you want to attend. I have applied for all three. At starting students will be shortlisted based on gate score 

## TI sponsored MS
19th may 2022

>It has 2 steps first is a written round of 10 questions and then an interview round. For preparation in analog domain you can watch the videos of IIT madras "Analog Circuits" (nptel) videos. The videos are enough for solving the questions asked in written exam. For TI sponsored, mosfet, BJT and opamp are the most important questions. Questiopns will be a combination of above like mosfet with opamp or different mosfet combination and their small signal analysis.Questions were of numerical type like small signal output to input ratio.

><5 students were shortlisted for interview round and I was fortunately one of them. >For me interview round began on that day only.In interview round they will ask on mistakes you have done in your written test. Out of 10 questions I had answered 8 correct and 2 wrong so most of my questions were on these 2 mistakes. Besides this they asked me on opamp.

>Simmilar to TI sponsored this had 2 rounds. One written and one interview. In written there will be a mixed question on mosfet, opamp, BJT and other concepts of analog(unlike TI sponsored where nearly all questions were on mosfet). There were a total of 10 questions and they were of numerical type.

>I was shortlisted for interview round and my interview began on that day only. I was asked questions on only network theory. All of the questions were from first order and second order systems where a circuit(consisting of R,L and C components) will be given and I need to find graph of some output voltage across capacitor or its equation or time constants etc.
